# Bloom and Bust: The Tale of the Dutch Tulip Bubble

_By Soham Dengra_

“History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”  
-Mark Twain

A stock market bubble can be defined as a situation wherein stock prices rise to unreasonably high levels in relation to their underlying fundamental or business value.
With Indian stock market indexes NIFTY and SENSEX touching their all-time highs and the broader stock market experiencing one of the biggest bull runs in its history, there has been an increasing amount of chatter around the creation of a “bubble” in the market. However, this is not the first time that such a bubble has been created.
Today, we’re going to look at the first recorded case of an asset bubble- The Dutch Tulip Bubble.

## What was the Dutch Tulip Bubble?

The Dutch tulip bubble aka the “Tulipmania” began when Ottoman traders introduced this flower to the Dutch during the early 1630s where it caught the eye of the rich, upper-class Dutch population. However, growing tulips was a painstaking process, with the flowers being notoriously fragile and requiring careful cultivation. Soon, the Dutch realised that growing new tulips from existing bulbs was much easier and faster than growing the plant from seeds. This newfound ease of growing the prestigious tulips, combined with the growing prosperity of the Dutch economy which had become a global hub for financial innovation, resulted in a growing demand for tulip bulbs.

Tulips, seen as status symbols and items indicating good taste, were limited only to the affluent class. However, with the introduction of tulip bulbs, Holland’s growing middle class of merchants and bankers soon got attracted to them in their attempts to emulate the wealthy class.

By 1634, the tulip mania had swept throughout Holland with tulip bulb prices increasing to unprecedented levels. Brokerages were set up to trade this prized asset and soon tulip bulbs were being traded for anywhere between $5,000-$150,000, with the rare and highly-valued Semper Augustus tulip bulbs selling for ~ $1 million in today's money. People started buying bulbs on credit (leverage) and this led to the birth of what are today called “margined derivative contracts”. At the height of this frenzy, some bulbs were selling for more than a house on the prime real estate of the Amsterdam Canal.

The tulips which were initially in demand because of their worth as status symbols soon derived much of their excessive value from speculators hoping to buy these bulbs at absurd prices, only to sell them to another person at an even higher, even more absurd price (pretty reminiscent of the NFT boom).

However, one thing which happens to all bubbles is- they pop. So did this one.

By 1637, the bulbs had become so expensive that buyers became scarce. As the demand declined, this bubble popped and tulip prices fell off a cliff. People had initially purchased bulbs on credit, hoping to repay when they sold their bulbs for a profit. However, as the prices kept falling, the holders were forced to sell their bulbs at any price they could get. Soon by 1638, tulip bulb prices were back to normal.

While the Dutch tulip mania may not have left the same impact on the economy as the economic crashes we’ve seen in recent times, it did leave many people with massive debts, ruined Dutch relations built on trust, and made the citizens cautious of speculation in trading.

The Dutch tulip bubble serves as a cautionary tale for investors even today, standing as a reminder that speculative manias can drive asset prices to unsustainable heights, often divorced from their fundamental value. It highlights the dangers of herd mentality and the risks associated with engaging in speculative investments in pursuit of quick gains, reminding us that speculation can never lead to sustainable long-term wealth creation.

# Diversification or Di-worsification?

_By Neel Issrani_

We've all heard the adage, “Never put all your eggs in one basket.” This is the concept of diversification. In the world of investing, diversification is often known as the golden rule- it has been a fundamental strategy that investors swear by.

## But why diversify?

At its core, diversification is about risk management. Spreading investments across various assets and sectors minimises the risks associated with market volatility. A well-diversified portfolio tends to have less volatile returns and helps cushion against significant losses, providing a smoother investment ride. This is because not all asset classes or sectors move down simultaneously.
